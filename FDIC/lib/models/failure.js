  /**
   * Create a Failure.
   * @property {object} [data]
   * @property {string} [data.nAME] This is the legal name of the institution.
   * When available, the Institution's name links to useful information for the
   * customers and vendors of these institutions. This information includes
   * press releases, information about the acquiring institution, (if
   * applicable), how your accounts and loans are affected, and how vendors can
   * file claims against the receivership.
   * @property {string} [data.cERT] The certificate number assigned by the FDIC
   * used to identify institutions and for the issuance of insurance
   * certificates. By clicking on this number, you will link to the Institution
   * Directory (ID) system which will provide the last demographic and
   * financial data filed by the selected institution.
   * @property {string} [data.fIN] Financial Institution Number (FIN) is a
   * unique number assigned to the institution as an Assistance Agreement,
   * Conservatorship, Bridge Bank or Receivership.
   * @property {string} [data.cITYST] The city and state (or territory) of the
   * headquarters of the institution.
   * @property {date} [data.fAILDATE] The date that the failed / assisted
   * institution ceased to exist as a privately held going concern. For
   * institutions that entered into government ownership, such as FDIC Bridge
   * Banks and RTC conservatorships, this is the date that they entered into
   * such ownership.
   * @property {string} [data.fAILYR] The 4-digit year that the failed /
   * assisted institution ceased to exist as a privately held going concern.
   * For institutions that entered into government ownership, such as FDIC
   * Bridge Banks and RTC conservatorships, this is the date that they entered
   * into such ownership.
   * @property {string} [data.sAVR] Before 1989, there were two federal deposit
   * insurance funds, one administered by the FDIC, which insured deposits in
   * commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks, and another
   * administered by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
   * (FSLIC), which insured deposits in state- and federally-chartered savings
   * associations. In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
   * Enforcement Act (FIRREA) specified that thereafter the FDIC would be the
   * federal deposit insurer of all banks and savings associations and would
   * administer both the FDIC fund, which was renamed the Bank Insurance Fund
   * (BIF) and the replacement for the insolvent FSLIC fund, which was called
   * the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although it was created in
   * 1989, the SAIF was not responsible for savings association failures until
   * 1996. From 1989 through 1995, savings association failures were the
   * responsibility of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). In February
   * 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 provided for the
   * merger of the BIF and the SAIF into a single Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).
   * Necessary technical and conforming changes to the law were made under The
   * Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005. The
   * merger of the funds was effective on March 31, 2006. For additional
   * information about deposit insurance fund and legislation, go to
   * http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/index.html. Possible values include:
   * 'BIF', 'RTC', 'FSLIC', 'SAIF', 'DIF', 'FDIC'
   * @property {string} [data.rESTYPE1] Institutions have been resolved through
   * several different types of transactions. The transaction types outlined
   * below can be grouped into three general categories, based upon the method
   * employed to protect insured depositors and how each transaction affects a
   * failed / assisted institution's charter. In most assistance transactions,
   * insured and uninsured depositors are protected, the failed / assisted
   * institution remains open and its charter survives the resolution process.
   * In purchase and assumption transactions, the failed / assisted
   * institution's insured deposits are transferred to a successor institution,
   * and its charter is closed. In most of these transactions, additional
   * liabilities and assets are also transferred to the successor institution.
   * In payoff transactions, the deposit insurer - the FDIC or the former
   * Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - pays insured depositors,
   * the failed / assisted institution's charter is closed, and there is no
   * successor institution. For a more complete description of resolution
   * transactions and the FDIC's receivership activities, see Managing the
   * Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a study prepared by the FDIC's
   * Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the
   * FDIC's Public Information Center.
   * Category 1 - Institution's charter survives
   * A/A	- Assistance Transactions. These include: 1) transactions where
   * assistance was provided to the acquirer, who purchased the entire
   * institution. For a few FSLIC transactions, the acquirer purchased the
   * entire bridge bank - type entity, but certain other assets were moved into
   * a liquidating receivership prior to the sale, and 2) open bank assistance
   * transactions, including those where assistance was provided under a
   * systemic risk determination (in such cases any costs that exceed the
   * amounts estimated under the least cost resolution requirement would be
   * recovered through a special assessment on all FDIC-insured institutions).
   * REP -	Reprivatization, management takeover with or without assistance at
   * takeover, followed by a sale with or without additional assistance.
   * Category 2 - Institution's charter is terminated, insured deposits plus
   * some assets and other liabilities are transferred to a successor charter
   * P&A - Purchase and Assumption, where some or all of the deposits, certain
   * other liabilities and a portion of the assets (sometimes all of the
   * assets) were sold to an acquirer. It was not determined if all of the
   * deposits (PA) or only the insured deposits (PI) were assumed.
   * PA - Purchase and Assumption, where the insured and uninsured deposits,
   * certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets were sold to an
   * acquirer.
   * PI - Purchase and Assumption of the insured deposits only, where the
   * traditional P&A was modified so that only the insured deposits were
   * assumed by the acquiring institution.
   * IDT - Insured Deposit Transfer, where the acquiring institution served as
   * a paying agent for the insurer, established accounts on their books for
   * depositors, and often acquired some assets as well. Includes ABT
   * (asset-backed transfer, a FSLIC transaction that is very similar to an
   * IDT).
   * MGR - An institution where FSLIC took over management and generally
   * provided financial assistance. FSLIC closed down before the institution
   * was sold.
   * Category 3
   * PO - Payout, where the insurer paid the depositors directly and placed the
   * assets in a liquidating receivership. Note: Includes transactions where
   * the FDIC established a Deposit Insurance National Bank to facilitate the
   * payout process. Possible values include: 'A/A', 'REP', 'P&A', 'PA', 'PI',
   * 'IDT', 'MGR', 'PO'
   * @property {string} [data.cHCLASS1] The FDIC assigns classification codes
   * indicating an institution's charter type (commercial bank, savings bank,
   * or savings association), its chartering agent (state or federal
   * government), its Federal Reserve membership status (member or nonmember),
   * and its primary federal regulator (state-chartered institutions are
   * subject to both federal and state supervision). These codes are:
   * N - National chartered commercial bank supervised by the Office of the
   * Comptroller of the Currency;
   * SM - State charter Fed member commercial bank supervised by the Federal
   * Reserve;
   * NM - State charter Fed nonmember commercial bank supervised by the FDIC;
   * SA - State or federal charter savings association supervised by the Office
   * of Thrift Supervision or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;
   * SB - State charter savings bank supervised by the FDIC. Possible values
   * include: 'N', 'SM', 'NM', 'SA', 'SB'
   * @property {string} [data.rESTYPE] The given institution has failure
   * stature or it can be assistance has been provided by FDIC in merging with
   * other institution. Possible values include: 'FAILURE', 'ASSISTANCE'
   * @property {number} [data.qBFDEP] Total including demand deposits, money
   * market deposits, other savings deposits, time deposits and deposits in
   * foreign offices as of the last Call Report or Thrift Financial Report
   * filed by the institution prior to the effective date. Note this does not
   * necessarily reflect total deposits on the last report filed because in
   * some cases reports were filed after the effective date.
   * @property {number} [data.qBFASSET] The Total assets owned by the
   * institution including cash, loans, securities, bank premises and other
   * assets as of the last Call Report or Thrift Financial Report filed by the
   * institution prior to the effective date. Note this does not necessarily
   * reflect total assets on the last report filed because in some cases
   * reports were filed after the effective date. This total does not include
   * off-balance-sheet accounts.
   * @property {number} [data.cOST] The estimated loss is the difference
   * between the amount disbursed from the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to
   * cover obligations to insured depositors and the amount estimated to be
   * ultimately recovered from the liquidation of the receivership estate.
   * Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed unrecoverable and
   * do not reflect interest that may be due on the DIF's administrative or
   * subrogated claims should its principal be repaid in full.
   * Notes:
   * Comprehensive data on estimated losses are not available for FDIC-insured
   * failures prior to 1986, or for FSLIC-insured failures from 1934-88.
   * Estimated loss is presented as "N/A" in years for which comprehensive
   * information is not available.
   * Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as 'Estimated Cost' in past
   * releases of the Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC receiverships,
   * the 'Estimated Cost' included an allocation of FDIC corporate revenue and
   * expense items such as interest expense on Federal Financing Bank debt,
   * interest expense on escrowed funds and interest revenue on advances to
   * receiverships. Other FDIC receiverships did not include such an
   * allocation. To maintain consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC
   * allocation is no longer reflected in the estimated loss amounts for failed
   * / assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC receiverships.
   * Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the 'Estimated Loss' in
   * the Historical Statistics on Banking is presented and defined consistently
   * with the aggregate Estimated Receivership Loss for FRF-RTC institutions
   * and Estimated Losses for FDIC receiverships that are reported in the
   * FDIC's Annual Report. The estimated loss is obtained from the FDIC's
   * Failed Bank Cost Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA
   * provides data for receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides
   * similar data back to 1989.
   * Questions regarding Estimated Loss should be sent to
   * DOFBusinessCenter@fdic.gov.
   * Also, for more detail regarding resolution transactions and the FDIC's
   * receivership activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC
   * Experience, a historical study prepared by the FDIC's Division of
   * Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the FDIC's Public
   * Information Center.
   * @property {string} [data.pSTALP] Two-character alphanumeric code for US
   * state or Territory
