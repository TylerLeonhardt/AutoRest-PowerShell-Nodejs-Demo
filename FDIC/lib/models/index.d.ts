   * required to indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an election to
   * file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar requirement as of March 1998.  The most
   * important IRS requirements to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more
   * than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock. (In general, shareholders
   * can only be individuals, estates, and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and
   * charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must consent.  Banks and
   * thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for tax
   * purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad debt
   * reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion.
   * (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate
   * allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the financial statements and
   * Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate
   * fair market value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on the date of
   * conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call
   * Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net income.
   * For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be
   * eliminated upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG
   * tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A Subchapter S corporation
   * is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax
   * purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its
   * taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and
   * the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income.
   * This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing
   * their after-tax earnings..   The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in
   * shareholders' personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically increase the
   * amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes.

   * Institutions have been resolved through several different types of transactions. The
   * transaction types outlined below can be grouped into three general categories, based upon the
   * method employed to protect insured depositors and how each transaction affects a failed /
   * assisted institution's charter. In most assistance transactions, insured and uninsured
   * depositors are protected, the failed / assisted institution remains open and its charter
   * survives the resolution process. In purchase and assumption transactions, the failed /
   * assisted institution's insured deposits are transferred to a successor institution, and its
   * charter is closed. In most of these transactions, additional liabilities and assets are also
   * transferred to the successor institution. In payoff transactions, the deposit insurer - the
   * FDIC or the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - pays insured depositors,
   * the failed / assisted institution's charter is closed, and there is no successor institution.
   * For a more complete description of resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership
   * activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a study prepared by the
   * FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the FDIC's Public
   * Information Center.
   * Category 1 - Institution's charter survives
   * A/A	- Assistance Transactions. These include: 1) transactions where assistance was provided to
   * the acquirer, who purchased the entire institution. For a few FSLIC transactions, the acquirer
   * purchased the entire bridge bank - type entity, but certain other assets were moved into a
   * liquidating receivership prior to the sale, and 2) open bank assistance transactions,
   * including those where assistance was provided under a systemic risk determination (in such
   * cases any costs that exceed the amounts estimated under the least cost resolution requirement
   * would be recovered through a special assessment on all FDIC-insured institutions).
   * REP -	Reprivatization, management takeover with or without assistance at takeover, followed by
   * a sale with or without additional assistance.
   * Category 2 - Institution's charter is terminated, insured deposits plus some assets and other
   * liabilities are transferred to a successor charter
   * P&A - Purchase and Assumption, where some or all of the deposits, certain other liabilities
   * and a portion of the assets (sometimes all of the assets) were sold to an acquirer. It was not
   * determined if all of the deposits (PA) or only the insured deposits (PI) were assumed.
   * PA - Purchase and Assumption, where the insured and uninsured deposits, certain other
   * liabilities and a portion of the assets were sold to an acquirer.
   * PI - Purchase and Assumption of the insured deposits only, where the traditional P&A was
   * modified so that only the insured deposits were assumed by the acquiring institution.
   * IDT - Insured Deposit Transfer, where the acquiring institution served as a paying agent for
   * the insurer, established accounts on their books for depositors, and often acquired some
   * assets as well. Includes ABT (asset-backed transfer, a FSLIC transaction that is very similar
   * to an IDT).
   * MGR - An institution where FSLIC took over management and generally provided financial
   * assistance. FSLIC closed down before the institution was sold.
   * Category 3
   * PO - Payout, where the insurer paid the depositors directly and placed the assets in a
   * liquidating receivership. Note: Includes transactions where the FDIC established a Deposit
   * Insurance National Bank to facilitate the payout process. Possible values include: 'A/A',
   * 'REP', 'P&A', 'PA', 'PI', 'IDT', 'MGR', 'PO'

   * Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed unrecoverable and do not reflect

   * Notes:

   * years for which comprehensive information is not available.
   * Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as 'Estimated Cost' in past releases of the
   * Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC receiverships, the 'Estimated Cost' included an
   * allocation of FDIC corporate revenue and expense items such as interest expense on Federal
   * Financing Bank debt, interest expense on escrowed funds and interest revenue on advances to
   * receiverships. Other FDIC receiverships did not include such an allocation. To maintain
   * consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC allocation is no longer reflected in the
   * estimated loss amounts for failed / assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC
   * receiverships.
   * Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the 'Estimated Loss' in the Historical
   * Statistics on Banking is presented and defined consistently with the aggregate Estimated
   * Receivership Loss for FRF-RTC institutions and Estimated Losses for FDIC receiverships that
   * are reported in the FDIC's Annual Report. The estimated loss is obtained from the FDIC's
   * Failed Bank Cost Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA provides data for
   * receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides similar data back to 1989.
   * Questions regarding Estimated Loss should be sent to DOFBusinessCenter@fdic.gov.
   * Also, for more detail regarding resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership
   * activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a historical study prepared
