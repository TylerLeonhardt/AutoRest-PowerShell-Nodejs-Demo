   * @property {string} [sUBCHAPS] The Small Business Job Protection Act of

   * elect Subchapter S corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are
   * required to indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in
   * effect an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
   * requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements to
   * elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more than 75
   * eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock. (In general,
   * shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and certain types of
   * trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable organizations will be
   * eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must consent.  Banks and thrifts
   * converting to Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method
   * for tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad
   * debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six years, if
   * the reserve method had been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though
   * the specific charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate
   * allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the
   * financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are subject to a
   * built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market value of assets is
   * greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to
   * Subchapter S status.     [Banks are required to indicate separately on the
   * Call Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income taxes
   * reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their
   * deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to
   * Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax and
   * the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A Subchapter S
   * corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership,
   * for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any
   * federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows
   * through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and
   * the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this
   * taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing institutions'
   * reported income tax expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..
   * The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in
   * shareholders' personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations
   * typically increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to
   * compensate for higher personal taxes.
