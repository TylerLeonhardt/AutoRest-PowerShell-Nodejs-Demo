# Examples
For now, examples are **not implemented**. In the future, examples may do the following:
- Used in documentation generation (`generate-docs.ps1`)
- Ran as or part of testing (`test-module.ps1`)
- Used in conceptual documentation
- Possibly generated (fully/partially)

These are a few high-level ideas and *are subject to change*.
