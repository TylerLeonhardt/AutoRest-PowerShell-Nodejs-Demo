                The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal
                Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S
                corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to
                indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an
                election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
                requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements
                to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more
                than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock.
                (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and
                certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable
                organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must
                consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must
                use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the
                reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad
                debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had
                been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific
                charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate
                allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the
                financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are
                subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market
                value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on
                the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are
                required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of
                each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net
                income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax
                assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to
                Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax
                and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A
                Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity,
                similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is
                generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate
                level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in
                proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally
                pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This
                can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax
                expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of
                Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders'
                personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically
                increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to
                compensate for higher personal taxes.

                The primary internet web address is the public internet site
                obtained from the most recent FFIEC Call Report (CALL) for
                commercial banks or from the supplemental information for Thrift
                Financial Reporters (TFR). The primary internet web address is
                included only for those institutions reporting an address on the
                most recent FFIEC Call Report or Thrift Financial Report.  This
                information resides in the most recent demographic information file.
                For some institutions users will find that for the item Primary
                Internet Web Address: the caption will read 'Web site not
                available'.  Possible reasons that a Web site may not be available
                are: The institution failed to file on the most recent call report
                or TFR. The institution filed a primary Internet Web address on its
                most recent FFIEC Call Report; however, the address filed by the
                institution was not in accordance with the instructions provided by
                the FFIEC on how to file a primary Internet Web address or FDIC
                attempts to validate and access the site were unsuccessful. Users
                may also experience instances where the URL provided for primary
                Internet Web address in ID returns an error stating that the site is
                not found. Possible reasons for such occurrences are: The
                institution?s reported primary Web address was valid as of the date
                that the demographic information was updated in ID, but is no longer
                valid. The institution?s reported Internet Web address is valid, but
                the institution?s Web site was inoperable at the time that the user
                attempted to access it due to technical problems being experienced
                by the institution?s Web site, the institution?s web provider, the
                user?s Web provider, or other issues not related to the validity of
                the Web address.  Users are advised to contact the institution on
                any questions regarding the services provided by the institution.
                For questions involving the reporting of primary Internet Web
                address by those institutions that file a FFIEC Call report, users
                are advised to contact supervision@fdic.gov.  For questions
                involving the primary Internet Web address of institutions that file
                a Thrift Financial Report, users are advised to contact
                pamela.schaar@ots.treas.gov or call Ms. Schaar at (202) 906-7205.

              description: Before 1989, there were two federal deposit insurance funds, one administered by the FDIC, which insured deposits in commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks, and another administered by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured deposits in state- and federally-chartered savings associations. In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) specified that thereafter the FDIC would be the federal deposit insurer of all banks and savings associations and would administer both the FDIC fund, which was renamed the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the replacement for the insolvent FSLIC fund, which was called the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although it was created in 1989, the SAIF was not responsible for savings association failures until 1996. From 1989 through 1995, savings association failures were the responsibility of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). In February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 provided for the merger of the BIF and the SAIF into a single Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Necessary technical and conforming changes to the law were made under The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005. The merger of the funds was effective on March 31, 2006. For additional information about deposit insurance fund and legislation, go to http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/index.html.

              description: |-
                Institutions have been resolved through several different types of transactions. The transaction types outlined below can be grouped into three general categories, based upon the method employed to protect insured depositors and how each transaction affects a failed / assisted institution's charter. In most assistance transactions, insured and uninsured depositors are protected, the failed / assisted institution remains open and its charter survives the resolution process. In purchase and assumption transactions, the failed / assisted institution's insured deposits are transferred to a successor institution, and its charter is closed. In most of these transactions, additional liabilities and assets are also transferred to the successor institution. In payoff transactions, the deposit insurer - the FDIC or the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - pays insured depositors, the failed / assisted institution's charter is closed, and there is no successor institution.

                Category 1 - Institution's charter survives
                A/A	- Assistance Transactions. These include: 1) transactions where assistance was provided to the acquirer, who purchased the entire institution. For a few FSLIC transactions, the acquirer purchased the entire bridge bank - type entity, but certain other assets were moved into a liquidating receivership prior to the sale, and 2) open bank assistance transactions, including those where assistance was provided under a systemic risk determination (in such cases any costs that exceed the amounts estimated under the least cost resolution requirement would be recovered through a special assessment on all FDIC-insured institutions).
                REP -	Reprivatization, management takeover with or without assistance at takeover, followed by a sale with or without additional assistance.
                Category 2 - Institution's charter is terminated, insured deposits plus some assets and other liabilities are transferred to a successor charter
                P&A - Purchase and Assumption, where some or all of the deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets (sometimes all of the assets) were sold to an acquirer. It was not determined if all of the deposits (PA) or only the insured deposits (PI) were assumed.
                PA - Purchase and Assumption, where the insured and uninsured deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets were sold to an acquirer.
                PI - Purchase and Assumption of the insured deposits only, where the traditional P&A was modified so that only the insured deposits were assumed by the acquiring institution.
                IDT - Insured Deposit Transfer, where the acquiring institution served as a paying agent for the insurer, established accounts on their books for depositors, and often acquired some assets as well. Includes ABT (asset-backed transfer, a FSLIC transaction that is very similar to an IDT).
                MGR - An institution where FSLIC took over management and generally provided financial assistance. FSLIC closed down before the institution was sold.
                Category 3
                PO - Payout, where the insurer paid the depositors directly and placed the assets in a liquidating receivership. Note: Includes transactions where the FDIC established a Deposit Insurance National Bank to facilitate the payout process.

              description: |-
                The FDIC assigns classification codes indicating an institution's charter type (commercial bank, savings bank, or savings association), its chartering agent (state or federal government), its Federal Reserve membership status (member or nonmember), and its primary federal regulator (state-chartered institutions are subject to both federal and state supervision). These codes are:
                N - National chartered commercial bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;
                SM - State charter Fed member commercial bank supervised by the Federal Reserve;
                NM - State charter Fed nonmember commercial bank supervised by the FDIC;
                SA - State or federal charter savings association supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;
                SB - State charter savings bank supervised by the FDIC.
              enum: 
                - N

              title: Estimated Loss
              description: |-
                The estimated loss is the difference between the amount disbursed from the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to cover obligations to insured depositors and the amount estimated to be ultimately recovered from the liquidation of the receivership estate. Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed unrecoverable and do not reflect interest that may be due on the DIF's administrative or subrogated claims should its principal be repaid in full.
                Notes:
                Comprehensive data on estimated losses are not available for FDIC-insured failures prior to 1986, or for FSLIC-insured failures from 1934-88. Estimated loss is presented as "N/A" in years for which comprehensive information is not available.
                Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as 'Estimated Cost' in past releases of the Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC receiverships, the 'Estimated Cost' included an allocation of FDIC corporate revenue and expense items such as interest expense on Federal Financing Bank debt, interest expense on escrowed funds and interest revenue on advances to receiverships. Other FDIC receiverships did not include such an allocation. To maintain consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC allocation is no longer reflected in the estimated loss amounts for failed / assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC receiverships.
                Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the 'Estimated Loss' in the Historical Statistics on Banking is presented and defined consistently with the aggregate Estimated Receivership Loss for FRF-RTC institutions and Estimated Losses for FDIC receiverships that are reported in the FDIC's Annual Report. The estimated loss is obtained from the FDIC's Failed Bank Cost Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA provides data for receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides similar data back to 1989. 
                Questions regarding Estimated Loss should be sent to DOFBusinessCenter@fdic.gov.
